## Lip cancer risk estimation in Scotland

This projects presents an estimation of lip cancer risk in Scotland. For our estimation, we use areal data and a model for small area disease risk estimation. We compute the Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) and predict the cancer risk using neighbourhood matrices and Bayesian inference. We summarize the results in an interactive map that shows the risk for each Scotland county. See code `Project_code.R`.

The data used for the estimation comes from the R package ”SpatialEpi”.
